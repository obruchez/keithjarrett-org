</P>
<P>I have been looking for an updated and reliable catalogue listing all of
Jarrett's works for a long while. I came up to find several sources but none
of them was so complete as I mean it should be. This is why I put together
all the info I had in order to get to an acceptable list.</P>
<P>I started adding one, two or even more albums a day in a unique web page
and within a couple of months the job was almost done. Then I sent a copy of
it to Lynn D. Newton; he helped me greatly checking the whole document and
mostly rewriting it, providing better style, grammar and look.</P>
<P>Since this document was published on the web, many persons wrote to me to
point out errors, suggest new listings and, more generally, to give any kind of
positive feedback. That's why I think the actual document has reached a high
grade of reliability, consistence and completeness. However, please do not
consider the discography to be perfect.

<P>I thought about having different formats for the discography
and incidentally I came across the Linux Doc standard. It requires
writing the source with a simple text editor following a SGML
template. So I have written a brief perl script to convert the
original HTML source to the standard Linux Doc SGML format. Starting
from the SGML source, several other formats can be generated
automatically, namely: HTML, PostScript, PDF, ASCII text and some less
used standard (such as RTF). Actually I only provide support for HTML,
PDF and ASCII text so please don't ask for anything else than these
ones. The PDF version looks much like a real book (I mean a printed
book, not one of those funny jazz score collections with tons of
wrong chord changes, keys and whatever) so I recommend this one if you
wish to have a printed copy of this document. The download page for
all of these versions is <CODE>

<P>The ECM web site is at <CODE>

<P>Eric Jarrett (Keith's brother) has started a web site which states
itself as being an official resource. The web site has a very active
forum where Eric kindly answers any reasonable question about his
brother. The address is <CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.keithjarrett.net/">http://www.keithjarrett.net/</A></CODE></P>
<P>There's a club on Yahoo! about Keith Jarrett with lots of activity. If
you're a real Jarrett fan, I'll definitely want to subscribe to this
group. The address is <CODE>

<P>Also have a look at Olivier Bruchez's Jarrett site at <CODE>

work</I>. I strongly recommend reading it. Lynn keeps a FAQ as well
on his site.</P>
<P>I also recommend reading these books:

<P>This notice's aim is to keep the Keith Jarrett Discography (KJD from now on)
being freely distributable. Of course I can't claim a copyright over a
listing of albums but it is my intention to make this document the most
accurate as possible, so this copyright notice basically says you can copy
and distribuite the KJD but you are not allowed to modify it unless you
contact me for approval. You are warmly encouraged instead to collaborate
with me in order to improve this document. </P>
<P>All source code (namely the sgml file used to obtain all versions of
the discography and basically all files found in the kjd.tar.gz file)
in the KJD is placed under the terms of the GNU General Public License,

<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6</A> <A HREF="disc.html#toc1.6">Disclaimer</A>
</H2>


<P>I'm writing the following because people often write to me in order to
contact Mr. Jarrett. So far I've received requests for bookings and
invitations to try Steinway pianos. That's funny but I want to make
clear to anyone out there that I have no contact with Mr. Jarrett or
his agent (if he has one). I have never met him. In other words, if it
isn't clear yet, <B>I have nothing to do with him</B>. The only reasonable
way to contact Mr. Jarrett is by way of ECM records. More info about
this can be found in Lynn D. Newton's FAQ on his pages.</P>
<P>After all I'm not a collector. I just owe a very few of the items listed
here. If you need a person who can give you an opinion about any of
Jarrett's works, that person is not me.</P>
<P>I am aware of errors in the original discographies I used to
obtain this one. I wish to thank the people who write to me so that
many of the errors can get fixed but some of the bugs may still be
laying around.</P>
<P>I have often thought about including pictures for covers of the albums
listed here but there might be copyright issues I don't want to get
involved with. After all, it's not hard to find the covers for most of the
albums on the WWW: have a look at the listing on <CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.cdnow.com/pagename=/RP/CDN/FIND/discography.html/ArtistID=JARRETT*KEITH/from=sr-8224315-1">CdNow.com</A></CODE>.</P>
<P>Please also keep in mind that this document was written while under a
strong Jarrett influence. Today I'm more focusing on the bebop scene
and basically all music made in jazz between the early fourties and
the end of the sixties. Yes, I always hear Jarrett's records with
the spirit of a jazz/classical piano student but I'm more focusing on
the roots of jazz now.</P>

</H2>


<P>Due to the great productivity of Mister Jarrett I had to split up his
discography into decades. I hope this results in best readability and ease
of consultation when you are accessing this resource via the world wide web.
Please note that the sort order is given by the date of publication of each
album, not by the recording date.</P>
<P>Most of the albums are catalogued this way:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Title of the album, <I>(Author)</I></LI>
<LI><B>Year of publication.</B>
General notes about the album (Has it been recorded live or in
studio? Where exactly? And when?). Album code.
Awards this album was given, if any.</LI>
<LI><B>Featuring:</B> Player One <I>(instrument played)</I>,
Player Two <I>(instrument played)</I>, ... , Player n 
<I>(instrument played)</I>.</LI>
<LI><B>Tracks:</B> Track One, Track Two, ... , Track n.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Some album is not shown this way but it shouldn't be too hard to guess the
right format for it.</P>
